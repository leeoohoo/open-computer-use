## Coding Standards

### Frontend (TypeScript/React)

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any`
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**:
  - Components: PascalCase (`ChatInterface.tsx`)
  - Functions/variables: camelCase (`getUserProfile`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_RETRIES`)
- **File Structure**: Keep components small and focused
- **Imports**: Organize imports (React, external, internal)
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier (runs on save)

**Example:**

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from "react"
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { api } from "@/lib/api"

interface ChatMessageProps {
  message: string
  role: "user" | "assistant"
}

export function ChatMessage({ message, role }: ChatMessageProps) {
  const [isVisible, setIsVisible] = useState(false)

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsVisible(true)
  }, [])

  return (
    <div className={`message message-${role}`}>
      {message}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Backend (Python)

- **Python**: Follow PEP 8 style guide
- **Type Hints**: Use type hints for function signatures
- **Docstrings**: Add docstrings to all public functions
- **Async**: Use async/await for I/O operations
- **Formatting**: Use Black for code formatting

**Example:**

```python
from typing import Dict, Optional, List
from pydantic import BaseModel

class TaskRequest(BaseModel):
    """Request model for task execution"""
    user_request: str
    context: Optional[str] = None

async def execute_task(
    task_id: str,
    request: TaskRequest,
    user_id: str
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Execute a task with the multi-agent system.

    Args:
        task_id: Unique identifier for the task
        request: Task request with user input
        user_id: ID of the requesting user

    Returns:
        Dictionary containing task results

    Raises:
        ValueError: If task_id is invalid
        RuntimeError: If execution fails
    """
    # Implementation here
    pass
```

## Project Structure

## Testing Guidelines

### Frontend Testing

We use Jest and React Testing Library:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

**Example Test:**

```typescript
import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react"
import { ChatMessage } from "./ChatMessage"

describe("ChatMessage", () => {
  it("renders user message correctly", () => {
    render(
      <ChatMessage
        message="Hello, world!"
        role="user"
      />
    )

    expect(screen.getByText("Hello, world!")).toBeInTheDocument()
  })
})
```

### Backend Testing

We use pytest:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_agents.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/
```

**Example Test:**

```python
import pytest
from app.services.multi_agent_executor import MultiAgentExecutor

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_task_planning():
    """Test that task planner creates valid plans"""
    executor = MultiAgentExecutor(
        machine_id="test_machine",
        connection_info={},
        provider=mock_provider
    )

    plan = await executor.plan_tasks("Search for Python tutorials")

    assert len(plan.subtasks) > 0
    assert plan.subtasks[0].assigned_agent is not None
```

## Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: CI runs tests and linting
2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer review required
3. **Testing**: Reviewer tests changes locally
4. **Feedback**: Address any requested changes
5. **Approval**: Maintainer approves and merges

**Review Timeline:**
- Initial review: Within 3-5 days
- Follow-up reviews: Within 1-2 days
- Urgent fixes: Within 24 hours
