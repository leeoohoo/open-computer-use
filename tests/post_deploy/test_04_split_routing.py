"""
test_04_split_routing — ALB path-based routing to the split services.

Why this file exists
====================
The three-service split (api / sse / ws) lives entirely in ALB listener rules.
A single misordered or missing rule looks exactly like an outage from the
user's point of view — the listener silently forwards traffic to the wrong
target group and the affected endpoint returns the other service's 404 HTML
or a stale sidecar response.  None of the service health checks catch it,
because the target groups themselves stay Healthy.

This file is the tripwire.  It verifies path-based routing over the three
independent ingress planes that end-user traffic uses:

    1. `:443` via Cloudflare  (`cfg().frontend_url`)
        User-facing HTTPS.  Routes:
          - /api/electron/ws   → ws-tg        (direct rule at priority 10)
          - /*                 → frontend-tg  (default action, Next.js)
        Next.js then proxies /api/chat, /api/chats etc. internally to
        PYTHON_BACKEND_URL — so hitting /api/chat on this plane exercises
        the FULL frontend-proxy chain, not a pure ALB rule.

    2. `:8001` direct ALB  (`cfg().backend_public_url`)
        Electron app + public API consumers.  Listener rules:
          - /api/electron/ws   → ws-tg        (priority 10)
          - /api/chat[/*]      → sse-tg       (priority 20)
          - /api/swarm[/*]     → sse-tg       (priority 30)
          - /*                 → api-tg       (priority 1000, catch-all)
        This plane IS the pure ALB routing test.

    3. Internal ALB (Next.js → Python backend) — owned by test_05.
        NOT tested here.  Don't duplicate.

How we identify the receiving service
=====================================
Ideally each service would echo its COASTY_SERVICE_MODE in a response header
or a /api/health/service-mode endpoint.  At the time of writing, no such
endpoint exists — the backend's /api/health endpoint returns the same JSON
body regardless of mode, and no shared middleware stamps a service-mode
header.  So these tests fall back to shape-based identification:

    * SSE service    → `Content-Type: text/event-stream` response
    * WS service     → 101 Switching Protocols on WebSocket upgrade
    * API service    → JSON body on /api/health; JSON 404 on unknown paths
                        (as opposed to Next.js HTML which the frontend-tg
                         returns for unknown paths)
    * Frontend-tg    → Either HTML response or Next.js framework headers

If a COASTY_SERVICE_MODE marker is ever added, swap these shape checks for
explicit equality assertions — a TODO at the top of each test points to the
envisioned upgrade.
