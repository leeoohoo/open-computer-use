"""
test_06_electron_flows.py — Post-deployment regression tests for the
Electron desktop app's network interactions with the backend.

What this suite regression-guards
---------------------------------
  * The `/api/electron/*` orphan-ALB-rule outage: a listener rule pointed at
    a removed target group, so every call to /api/electron/machines (both the
    web proxy path AND the direct backend path) black-holed with 502s. Any
    test marked `routing` in here fails if that rule regresses.
  * The renderer auto-sign-out loop: the backend previously emitted a
    generic WebSocket close on bad credentials, which the Electron renderer
    conflated with a transient network blip and kept retrying forever. The
    fix introduced a distinct `auth_failed` (backend) / `auth_error` (renderer
    state) signal. Tests 3/4/16 here prove the server STILL sends
    `auth_failed` as a JSON frame before closing — not a TCP RST, not a
    silent close, not an HTTP 500.
  * Generic Electron WS breakage: any change to the path, the first-message
    auth schema, the heartbeat cadence, or the TLS cert on :443 (Cloudflare)
    or :8001 (direct ALB) surfaces as a failure in tests 1/2/5.
  * Chat-send path regressions: Electron POSTs /api/chat/ with a Bearer
    token and expects SSE. Tests 8/9 prove both the Cloudflare :443 and the
    direct :8001 paths still accept this.
  * stop-machine and resume-human endpoint crashes: tests 10/11 assert the
    endpoints respond gracefully (not 500) even when there is no session to
    stop/resume — the happy paths without an active chat.

Machine-id naming convention
----------------------------
Every test in this file uses `post-deploy-smoke-{user_id[:8]}` as its
machine_id. If a test leaves state behind in Supabase (should be rare —
none of these tests complete a full machine-registration round-trip via
the real Electron app flow), the operator can grep for the literal prefix
`post-deploy-smoke-` in the `user_machines` table during triage.

The `post-deploy-smoke-` prefix is stable across runs on purpose: if two
CI runs race, they will target the same machine_id and the server's
"last auth wins" semantics handle that cleanly. We do NOT randomize the
suffix because a stable prefix is easier to grep in logs than a UUID.

WebSocket client choice
-----------------------
We use `websockets.sync.client.connect()` (the sync client) throughout.
Rationale: the suite has no other async tests, we don't want to pull in
pytest-asyncio just for this one file, and the sync client is a thin
wrapper over the same protocol implementation so we lose nothing. Each
WS test opens a fresh connection — the websockets client is NOT
session-safe because TCP/TLS state depends on the specific URL and
timeout semantics of each test.

Time budget
-----------
Every WS test must finish in <10s. The chat-send SSE tests have a hard
3s read-abort so they never consume more than a single LLM frame, which
keeps the suite from burning model credits on any run.
