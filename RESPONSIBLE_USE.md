## Security Best Practices

### 1. Credential Management

**DO:**
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Enable encryption (ENCRYPTION_KEY)
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use least-privilege access
- Store credentials securely

**DON'T:**
- Hardcode passwords or API keys
- Share credentials with others
- Use the same password across services
- Store credentials in VM environments
- Log sensitive information

### 2. VM Isolation

**DO:**
- Use isolated Docker containers
- Limit network access when possible
- Monitor resource usage
- Clean up containers regularly
- Use ephemeral environments

**DON'T:**
- Run untrusted code without isolation
- Share VMs across users
- Persist sensitive data in VMs
- Disable security features
- Allow unlimited resource usage

### 3. Code Security

**DO:**
- Review generated commands before execution
- Validate user inputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Sanitize file paths
- Implement rate limiting

**DON'T:**
- Execute arbitrary code without review
- Trust user input blindly
- Disable security warnings
- Skip input validation
- Ignore security alerts

**What we DON'T collect:**
- API keys or credentials (encrypted locally)
- Personal data from your agents
- Content of your conversations (unless explicitly shared)
- Browser history or private information

### User Responsibilities

- Comply with GDPR, CCPA, and applicable privacy laws
- Obtain consent before collecting personal data
- Provide privacy notices to data subjects
- Implement data protection measures
- Honor data deletion requests

---

## Legal Compliance

### Website Terms of Service

**Always:**
- Review and comply with website ToS before automation
- Check robots.txt files and respect directives
- Honor rate limits and crawl-delay settings
- Identify your bot in user-agent strings
- Stop if requested by site owners

**Example robots.txt compliance:**
```
# Respect these directives
User-agent: *
Disallow: /private/
Crawl-delay: 10
```

### Copyright & Fair Use

- Only scrape content where legally permitted
- Respect copyright notices
- Apply fair use principles appropriately
- Provide attribution when required
- Obtain licenses for commercial use

### Anti-Spam Laws

- Comply with CAN-SPAM Act (USA)
- Follow GDPR marketing rules (EU)
- Respect opt-out requests immediately
- Include accurate sender information

---

## Rate Limiting & Resource Usage

### Respectful Automation

**Best practices:**
- Implement delays between requests (e.g., 1-5 seconds)
- Respect HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
- Use caching to minimize redundant requests
- Batch operations when possible
- Monitor bandwidth usage

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Respect rate limits
await asyncio.sleep(2)  # 2 second delay between requests

# Bad: Aggressive scraping
for i in range(1000):
    scrape_page(i)  # No delays
```

### Resource Quotas

**Self-imposed limits:**
- Max 60 requests per minute per domain
- Max 1000 pages per session
- Max 2GB memory per VM
- Max 4 CPU cores per VM
- Max 2 hour session duration
