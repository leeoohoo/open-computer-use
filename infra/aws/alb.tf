# HTTPS listener rule — route /api/electron/ws directly to the ws service.
#
# Background
# ----------
# The Electron desktop app opens its WebSocket bridge against its configured
# backend URL — which is `https://coasty.ai` (port 443) in the shipped .env.
# ws-bridge.ts builds the URL as:
#     `${backendUrl.replace(/^http/, 'ws')}/api/electron/ws`
# so the resulting URL is `wss://coasty.ai/api/electron/ws` on port 443.
#
# Without this rule, that request hits the HTTPS listener's default_action and
# is forwarded to the frontend target group (Next.js on :3000).  Next.js has
# no handler for `/api/electron/ws` (API routes can't answer raw WebSocket
# upgrades), the upgrade is rejected, and the bridge ends up in 'error' state.
# Combined with the renderer's auto-sign-out on connection error, the user is
# kicked back to the auth screen immediately after signing in — the symptom
# reported as "sign-in doesn't work".
#
# The same path already has a rule on the :8001 listener (see
# split_electron_ws in ecs_split.tf).  Adding the mirrored rule on :443 makes
# the routing work regardless of whether Cloudflare (or any other edge) is
# rewriting ports or preserving :443.  Exact-path match (no wildcard) ensures
# only the WS endpoint is diverted — all other `/api/electron/*` paths
# (proxy/*, machines, machines/{id}/*) continue to go to Next.js as before.
#
# Gated on `three_service_split_enabled` because the target (aws_lb_target_group.ws)
# only exists when the split is on; in the legacy sidecar-only topology
# there's no separate ws service to forward to and /api/electron/ws is
# served by the in-task backend via Next.js's proxy route on :443.
