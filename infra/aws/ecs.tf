              #     exits via NAT; the ALB SG rule "from ECS SG" rejects the
              #     NAT-sourced packet.  Dropped.
              #   • Route53 private hosted zone with alias to the public ALB —

# On 2026-04-23T03:18Z (23:18 EDT 04-23) the frontend received a 1,040
# req/s burst against a single Next.js task.  P99 latency climbed to
# 53.38 s — past the public ALB's 60 s idle timeout — and 970 of those
# requests came back as ELB 5xx.  The auto-scaling policies in place at
# the time (CPU 70% / memory 80%) never fired: Next.js's request queue
# fills up before CPU saturates, so by the time CPU would trip the alarm
# the requests are already timing out.
#
# ALBRequestCountPerTarget reacts to *queue length* (effectively, RPS per
# task), not CPU.  At >200 sustained reqs/min per running task, scale out
# before the queue overflows.  This is a leading indicator; CPU/memory
# remain as backstop policies for workloads that are CPU-bound rather
# than I/O-bound.
#
# `resource_label` is the special "<alb-arn-suffix>/<tg-arn-suffix>" form
# required by ALBRequestCountPerTarget so the autoscaling target knows
# WHICH ALB target group's request count to monitor.  See
