# =============================================================================
# CloudWatch alarms — paged on-call when the platform is degrading
# =============================================================================
#
# Why this file exists
# --------------------
# Pre-this-file, the account had **zero** alarms with prefix `${var.project_name}-`.
# Three real production incidents in the last 48 hours each happened with NO
# pager fire:
#
#   1. 2026-04-23T03:18Z — frontend hit by 1,040 RPS in 60s, P99 latency
#      53.38s, 970 ELB 5XX (93% error rate at peak).  Self-recovered when
#      the burst ended.  Detected after-the-fact via post-deploy log dive.
#
#   2. 2026-04-24T03:18Z — V8 OOM kill, container died with FATAL ERROR:
#      Reached heap limit.  Detected via post-deploy log dive only.
#
#   3. 2026-04-24T20:45Z — internal-key/service-role auth incident,
#      122 401s + 213 403s for ~23 minutes.  Detected via post-deploy log
#      dive; root cause was likely a rotation that wasn't propagated to
#      every service simultaneously.
#
# This file is the minimum-viable alarm set that would have paged on each
# of those.  All alarms are gated on `var.enable_alarms` (default true) and
# all notify a single SNS topic that subscribers can fan out.
#
# Naming convention
# -----------------
#   `${var.project_name}-<surface>-<metric>-<level>`
#
#   surface ∈ { alb, alb-int, frontend, api, sse, ws, ecs, db }
#   metric  ∈ { 5xx, 4xx, latency, unhealthy, cpu, mem, rejected }
#   level   ∈ { burst, sustained, p99 }   (omit when unambiguous)
#
# Cost
# ----
# CloudWatch alarms are billed per metric × period × month at $0.10/alarm.
# 14 alarms ≈ $1.40/month.  Pager noise has a much higher operational cost
# than that.
#
# Subscribing to the SNS topic
# ----------------------------
# By default we set up an EMAIL subscription IF `var.alarm_email` is given.
# For PagerDuty / Slack / Opsgenie, manually subscribe the topic ARN
# (exposed via the `alarms_sns_topic_arn` output) — the integration is
# outside-of-Terraform so people can rotate URLs without a TF apply.
#
# Disabling for staging
# ---------------------
# Set `enable_alarms = false` in tfvars.  All resources in this file
# evaluate to zero — no SNS topic, no alarms.  Useful when standing up a
# transient staging stack you don't want paging the prod oncall.

# UnHealthyHostCount is published per (TG × ALB).  We alarm on each TG that
# user-visible traffic depends on.  Internal-ALB and SSE TGs are tolerated
# slightly differently:
#
#   * frontend-tg  : any unhealthy host is bad (1 of 2 = 50% capacity loss)
#   * api/sse/ws-tg: same
#   * sse TGs (latency)   : NO P99 alarm — SSE streams are long-lived, P99
#                           latency is naturally 10–30 s for time-to-first-
#                           chunk.  Alarming would page constantly.
#   * frontend-tg (latency): P99 > 5s for 10min indicates queue overflow,
#                            same surface as the 23:18Z incident.
